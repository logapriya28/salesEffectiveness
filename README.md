# SalesEffectiveness
This project was undertaken to address the challenges faced by an IT solution provider. As the market matures and new competitors emerge, they experienced a decline in sales. The key focus was on leveraging Machine Learning to enhance lead categorization, thereby boosting sales effectiveness.

## 1. Data Exploration Insights - Sales Effectiveness:
   - Explored and analyzed data to gain valuable insights into sales effectiveness.
   - Uncovered patterns, trends, and key factors influencing sales performance.

## 2. ML Model for Lead Category Prediction:
   - Developed a machine learning model to predict lead categories (High Potential, Low Potential).
   - The aim is to automate and improve the pre-categorization process for better sales outcomes.
## Objective
The project's primary objective is to enhance sales by implementing a Machine Learning model. This model pre-categorizes leads, focusing on high and low-potential categories. By automating this process, the organization can anticipate a substantial increase in sales effectiveness.
